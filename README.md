Hello everyone

My name is Martin, and I'm from Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. For a long 17 years, I dedicated myself to mechanical engineering, specifically machining using CNC machines and programming them. At the age of 36 (in the year 2000), I started programming frontend in my free time, and for the next two years, I worked hard to gain my initial experience. I began my professional career in 2002. Again, I dedicated two years to gaining more experience, mainly with JavaScript, but this time professionally. Now, I want to move forward and start working on transforming into a full-stack developer. My primary focus is on React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. I will gradually strive to add better and better projects. I welcome any criticism or ideas for improvement. Every project of mine listed here is, of course, freely available for you.

Thank you.
